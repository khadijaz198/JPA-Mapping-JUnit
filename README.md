In this project commissioned by ACME Corp, I've meticulously mapped a college database schema to Plain Old Java Objects (POJOs). Each entity within the database now has a corresponding Java class, simplifying data manipulation and integration. Comprehensive JUnit tests have been implemented to ensure the accuracy of these mappings, guaranteeing seamless functionality for ACME Corp's college management system.
